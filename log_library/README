Add a prebuilt static liblog.a for this project, this is because below 3 functions are not accessiable when enabling VNDK with the flag "BOARD_VNDK_VERSION:=current".

android_openEventTagMap
android_log_processBinaryLogBuffer
android_log_processLogBuffer


This is only workaound, the right way is NOT using this functions
